 * Timer expiration handler for cyclic hrtimers.  Cyclic worker functions must

 *
 * But... under heavy load it is possible that the hrtimer will expire again
 * before the workqueue had a chance to run.  That would lead to missed events
 * which isn't quite acceptable.  Therefore, we use a counter to record how
 * many times the timer has expired vs how many times the handler has been
 * called.  The counter is incremented by this function upon hrtimer expiration
 * and decremented by the cyclic_fire.  Note that the workqueue is responsible
 * for calling the handler multiple times if the counter indicates that multiple
 * invocation are pending.
 *
 * This function is called as hrtimer handler, and therefore runs in interrupt
 * context, which by definition will ensure that manipulation of the 'pend'
 * counter in the cyclic can be done without locking, and changes will appear
 * atomic to the cyclic_fire().
 *
 * Moral of the story: the handler may not get called at the absolute times as
 * requested, but it will be called the correct number of times.
