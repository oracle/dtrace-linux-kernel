/*
 * The status of DTrace is relayed via the dtrace_status structure.  This
 * structure contains members to count drops other than the capacity drops
 * available via the buffer interface (see above).  This consists of dynamic
 * drops (including capacity dynamic drops, rinsing drops and dirty drops), and
 * speculative drops (including capacity speculative drops, drops due to busy
 * speculative buffers and drops due to unavailable speculative buffers).
 * Additionally, the status structure contains a field to indicate the number
 * of "fill"-policy buffers have been filled and a boolean field to indicate
 * that exit() has been called.  If the dtst_exiting field is non-zero, no
 * further data will be generated until tracing is stopped (at which time any
 * enablings of the END action will be processed); if user-level sees that
 * this field is non-zero, tracing should be stopped as soon as possible.
