/*
 * In order to get a snapshot of the principal or aggregation buffer,
 * user-level passes a buffer description to the kernel with the dtrace_bufdesc
 * structure.  This describes which CPU user-level is interested in, and
 * where user-level wishes the kernel to snapshot the buffer to (the
 * dtbd_data field).  The kernel uses the same structure to pass back some
 * information regarding the buffer:  the size of data actually copied out, the
 * number of drops, the number of errors, and the offset of the oldest record.
 * If the buffer policy is a "switch" policy, taking a snapshot of the
 * principal buffer has the additional effect of switching the active and
 * inactive buffers.  Taking a snapshot of the aggregation buffer _always_ has
 * the additional effect of switching the active and inactive buffers.
