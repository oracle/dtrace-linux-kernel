# DTrace kernel patches

This tree contains kernels modified to work with [DTrace](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-utils).

There are three varieties of kernel in here:

- Branches named v2/*: kernels with patches needed for the current DTrace implementation.
- Branches named v1/* or just with a version number: the previous DTrace implementation with a large kernel module component.
- Branches with other names: development branches (usually related to v2).
